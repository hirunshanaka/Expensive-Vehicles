<h1><i> <u> History </u></i></h1>


<p>

<b>1980s: The F1 project</b>

<br><br>

The Lexus brand was created around the same time as Japanese rivals Nissan and Honda developed their Infiniti and Acura premium brands. 
The Japanese government imposed voluntary export restraints for the U.S. market, so it was more profitable for Japanese automakers to export more expensive cars to the U.S.<br><br>

In 1983, Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda issued a challenge to build the world's best car.
The project, code-named F1 (“Flagship One”) developed the Lexus LS 400 to expand Toyota's product line in the premium segment.
The F1 project followed the Toyota Supra sports car and the premium Toyota Mark II models.
Both the Supra and Mark II were rear-wheel drive cars with a powerful 7M-GE or 7M-GTE inline-six engine. 
The largest sedan Toyota built at the time was the limited-production, 1960s-vintage Toyota Century, a domestic, hand-built limousine, and V8-powered model,followed by the inline-six-engined Toyota Crown premium sedan.
The Century was conservatively styled for the Japanese market and along with the Crown not slated for export after a restyle in 1982.
The F1 designers targeted their new sedan at international markets and began development on a new V8 engine.<br><br>

Japanese manufacturers exported more expensive models in the 1980s due to voluntary export restraints negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives that restricted mainstream car sales.
In 1986, Honda launched its Acura marque in the U.S., influencing Toyota's plans for a luxury division.
The initial Acura model was an export version of the Honda Legend, itself launched in Japan in 1985 as a rival to the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric/Gloria and Mazda Luce.
In 1987, Nissan unveiled its plans for a premium brand, Infiniti,and revised its Nissan President sedan in standard wheelbase form for export as the Infiniti Q45, which it launched in 1990.
Mazda began selling the Luce as the Mazda 929 in North America in 1988 and later began plans to develop an upscale marque to be called Amati, but its plans did not come to fruition.<br><br>

Toyota researchers visited the U.S. in May 1985 to conduct focus groups and market research on luxury consumers.
During that time, several F1 designers rented a home in Laguna Beach, California, to observe the lifestyles and tastes of American upper class consumers.
Meanwhile, F1 engineering teams conducted prototype testing on locations ranging from the German autobahn to U.S. roads.
Toyota's market research concluded that a separate brand and sales channel were needed to present its new sedan, and plans were made to develop a new network of dealerships in the U.S. market.<br><br>
<br>

<b>Brand development</b>
<br><br>

In 1986, Toyota's longtime advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi formed a specialized unit, Team One, to handle marketing for the new brand.
Image consulting firm Lippincott & Margulies was hired to develop a list of 219 prospective names; Vectre, Verone, Chaparel, Calibre and Alexis were chosen as top candidates.
While Alexis quickly became the front runner, concerns were raised that the name applied to people more than cars (being associated with the Alexis Carrington character on the popular 1980s prime time drama Dynasty).As a result, the first letter was removed and the "i" replaced with a "u" to morph the name to Lexus.
<br><br>

Theories of the etymology of the Lexus name have suggested it is the combination of the words "luxury" and "elegance,"and that it is an acronym for "luxury exports to the U.S." According to Team One interviews, the brand name has no specific meaning and simply denotes a luxurious and technological image.
Prior to the release of the first vehicles, database service LexisNexis obtained a temporary injunction forbidding the name Lexus from being used because it might cause product confusion.
The injunction threatened to delay the division's launch and marketing efforts.The U.S. appeals court lifted the injunction, deciding that there was little likelihood of confusion between the two products.
<br><br>

The original Lexus slogan, developed after Team One representatives visited Lexus designers in Japan and noted an obsessive attention to detail, became "The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection."
Three firms were involved in the final phase of logo development: Saatchi & Saatchi, Molly Designs and Hunter/Korobkin, Inc.
The finished logo was a combination of two firms’ final designs: the Lexus logo typeface came from Saatchi & Saatchi and the “L” was Hunter/Korobkin, Inc.’s design. 
According to Toyota, the automaker made some refinements so the logo would be easier to manufacture, rendering it using a mathematical formula.
The first teaser ads featuring the Lexus name and logo appeared at the Chicago, Los Angeles and New York auto shows in 1988.
<br><br><br>

<b>Launch</b>
<br><br>

The F1 project was completed in 1989, involving 60 designers, 24 engineering teams, 1,400 engineers, 2,300 technicians, 220 support workers, approximately 450 prototypes and more than $1 billion in costs.
The resulting car, the Lexus LS 400, had a design that shared no major elements with previous Toyota vehicles, with a new 4.0 L V8 gasoline engine and rear-wheel drive.
The car debuted in January 1989 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit and official sales of the vehicle began the following September at a network of 81 new Lexus dealerships in the U.S.
The LS 400 was sold along with the smaller ES 250, a rebadged version of the Japanese market Toyota Camry Prominent/Toyota Vista.The launch of Lexus was accompanied by a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign.
<br><br>

The LS 400 was praised for its quietness, well-appointed and ergonomic interior, engine performance, build quality, aerodynamics, fuel economy and value.
However, it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative styling and a suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort.
In some markets it was priced against mid-size, six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models.
It was rated by Car and Driver magazine as better than the higher-priced Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL and BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling and performance.
The LS 400 also won motoring awards from automotive publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine.
Lexus quickly established customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded as a shock to existing luxury marques. 
BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while 35 percent of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac.
<br><br>

In December 1989, Lexus initiated a voluntary recall of all 8,000 LS 400s based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated brake light.
A 20-day operation to replace the parts on affected vehicles included technicians to pick up, repair and return cars to customers free of charge, and also flying personnel and renting garage space for owners in remote locations.
This response was covered in media publications and helped establish the marque's early reputation for customer service.
<br><br>

By the end of 1989, a total of 16,392 LS 400 and ES 250 sedans were sold in the four months following the U.S. launch.
Although sales had begun at a slower pace than expected, the final tally matched the division's target of 16,000 units for that year.
Following initial models, plans called for the addition of a sports coupe along with a redesigned ES sedan.
<br><br><br>

<b>1990s: Growth and expansion</b>
<br><br>

In 1990, during its first full year of sales, Lexus sold 63,594 LS 400 and ES 250 sedans in the U.S.,the majority being the LS model.
That year, Lexus also began limited exports to the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada and Australia.
In 1991, Lexus launched its first sports coupe, the SC 400, which shared the LS 400s V8 engine and rear-wheel drive design.
This was followed by the second generation ES 300 sedan, which succeeded the ES 250 and became Lexus' top seller.
At the conclusion of 1991, Lexus had become the top-selling premium car import in the U.S.,with sales reaching 71,206 vehicles.
That year, Lexus ranked highest in J.D. Power and Associates' studies on initial vehicle quality, customer satisfaction and sales satisfaction for the first time.
The marque also began increasing U.S. model prices past those of comparable American premium makes, but still below high-end European models.By 1992, the LS 400's base price had risen 18 percent.
<br><br>

In 1993, Lexus launched the mid-size GS 300 sports sedan, based on the Toyota Aristo using the Toyota "S" platform from the Toyota Crown, which had sold for two years prior in Japan.
The GS 300 was priced below the LS 400 in the marque's lineup. That same year, Lexus became one of the first marques to debut a certified pre-owned program, with the aim of improving trade-in model values.
The marque introduced the second generation LS 400 in 1994. In May 1995, sales were threatened by the U.S. government's proposal of 100 percent tariffs on upscale Japanese cars in response to the widening U.S.-Japan trade deficit.
SUVs were exempt from the proposed sanctions.Normal sales operations resumed by late 1995 when the Japanese auto manufacturers collectively agreed to greater American investments and the tariffs were not enacted.
<br><br>

In 1996, Lexus debuted its first sport utility vehicle, the LX 450,followed by the third generation ES 300 sedan, and the second generation GS 300 and GS 400 sedans in 1997. 
The marque's plans for developing an SUV model had accelerated during the U.S.-Japan tariff discussions of 1995.Lexus added the first luxury-branded crossover SUV, the RX 300 in 1998. 
The RX crossover targeted suburban buyers who desired an upmarket SUV but did not need the LX's off-road capability.It was particularly successful, eventually becoming the marque's top-selling model ahead of the ES sedan.The same year, Lexus made its debut in South America's most populous country when it launched sales in Brazil.In 1999, the IS was introduced, an entry-level sport sedan. 
Lexus also recorded its 1 millionth vehicle sold in the U.S. market,being ranked as the top-selling premium car maker in the U.S. overall.
<br><br><br>

<b>2000s: Global reorganization</b>
<br><br>

In July 2000, Lexus introduced the IS 300 in North America, following global launch in 1999 (as the IS 200) and the third generation LS 430. In 2001, the first convertible was introduced, as well as the SC 430 and a redesigned ES 300.
The GX 470 mid-size SUV debuted in 2002, followed by the second generation RX 330 in 2003.[64] The following year, Lexus recorded its 2 millionth U.S. vehicle sale,and the first luxury-branded production hybrid SUV, the RX 400h.
This vehicle used Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system that combined gasoline and electric motors.
<br><br>

In 2005, Lexus completed an organizational separation from parent company Toyota, with dedicated design, engineering, training, and manufacturing centers working exclusively for the division.
This effort coincided with Lexus' launch in its home market of Japan and an expanded global launch of the brand in markets such as China.
Executives aimed to increase Lexus sales outside of its largest market in the U.S.
To accompany this expansion, next generation Lexus vehicles were redesigned as "global models" for international release.
In the European market, where Lexus had long faced struggling sales owing to low brand recognition, few dedicated dealerships, and 1990s import quotas,the marque announced plans to introduce hybrid and diesel powertrains,increase the number of Lexus dealerships, and expand operations in emerging markets such as Russia.
<br><br>

Lexus' arrival in the Japanese market in July 2005 marked the first introduction of a Japanese premium car marque in the domestic market.
New generation LS, IS, ES, GS, and RX models subsequently became available in Japan along with the SC 430, ending domestic sales of Toyota-branded models under the Celsior, Altezza, Windom, Aristo, Harrier, and Soarer nameplates, respectively. 
The Altezza and Aristo were previously exclusive to Japanese Toyota retail sales channels called Toyota Vista Store, the Windom was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store, the Celsior and Harrier were exclusive to Toyopet Store, and the Soarer was previously available at both Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations.
Lexus models sold in Japan featured higher specifications and a price premium compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts.
Sales for the first half-year were slower than expected,affected by the contraction of the domestic auto market and price increases,but improved in subsequent months with an expanded lineup.
<br><br>

Through the mid-2000s, Lexus experienced sales successes in South Korea and Taiwan, becoming the top-selling import make in both markets in 2005;the marque also sold well in the Middle East, where it ranked first or second among rivals in multiple countries,and in Australia, where Lexus reached third in luxury car sales in 2006.
Division executives in 2006 announced an expansion goal from 68 countries to 76 worldwide by 2010.
By the end of the decade, this expansion resulted in official launches in Malaysia and South Africa in 2006,Indonesia in 2007,Chile in 2008,and the Philippines in 2009.
<br><br><br>

<b>Hybrids and F models</b>
<br><br>

In 2006, Lexus began sales of the GS 450h, a V6 hybrid performance sedan,and launched the fourth generation LS line, comprising both standard- and long-wheelbase V8 (LS 460 and LS 460 L) and hybrid (LS 600h and LS 600h L) versions.
The fifth generation ES 350 also debuted in the same year. The LS 600h L subsequently went on sale as the most expensive sedan ever produced in Japan.
By the end of 2006, Lexus' annual sales had reached 475,000 vehicles worldwide.
In January 2007, Lexus announced a new F marque performance division, which would produce racing-inspired versions of its performance models. 
The IS F, made its debut at the 2007 North American International Auto Show,accompanied by a concept car, the LF-A.
<br><br>

In October 2007, Lexus entered the Specialty Equipment Market Association show in the U.S. for the first time with the IS F, and announced its F-Sport performance trim level and factory-sanctioned accessory line.
Increased emphasis on sporty models was an effort to target rivals from Mercedes-Benz's AMG and BMW's M divisions.
Models such as the SC 400 and GS 400 had received favorable reactions from sport luxury buyers,most Lexus models had been characterized as favoring comfort over sporty road feel and handling, compared with European rivals.
By the end of 2007, Lexus annual worldwide sales had surpassed 500,000 vehicles,and the marque ranked as the top-selling premium import in China for the first time.
The largest sales markets in order of size for 2007 were the U.S., Japan, the UK, China, Canada, and Russia.
<br><br>

In 2008, amidst the late-2000s recession and a weakened world car market, global sales fell 16 percent to 435,000,with declines in markets such as the U.S. and Europe where deliveries fell by 21 percent and 27.5 percent, respectively.
In 2009, the marque launched the HS 250h,a dedicated hybrid sedan for North America and Japan, the RX 450h, the second generation hybrid SUV replacing the earlier RX 400h, and later that year debuted the US$375,000 production LFA exotic coupe.
In late 2009, citing higher sales of hybrid models over their petrol counterparts,Lexus announced plans to become a hybrid-only marque in Europe.
By the end of the decade, Lexus ranked as the fourth-largest premium car make in the world by volume,and was the number one selling premium car marque in the U.S. for 10 consecutive years.
<br><br><br>

<b>2010s–2020s: Recent developments</b>
<br><br>

In 2010, Lexus underwent a gradual sales recovery in North America and Asia as the marque focused on adding hybrids and new model derivatives.
Sales in the U.S. held steady despite the 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls, several of which included Lexus models.
The ES 350 and certain IS models were affected by a recall for potentially jamming floor mats,while parent company Toyota bore the brunt of negative publicity amid investigations over its series of product recalls and problem rates per-vehicle.
The redesigned GX 460 was also voluntarily recalled in April 2010 for a software update, one week after Consumer Reports issued a recommendation not to buy the SUV, citing a possible rollover risk following the slow stability control response to a high-speed emergency turn.
Although the publication knew of no reported incidents, the GX 460 received updated stability control software.
<br><br>

In late 2010 and early 2011, Lexus began sales of the CT 200h, a compact four-door hybrid hatchback designed for Europe, in multiple markets.
Sales of lower-displacement regional models were also expanded, beginning with the ES 240 in China followed by the RX 270; Japan, Russia, and Taiwan were among markets which received model variants intended for reduced emissions or import taxes.
In March 2011, the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami caused severe disruption to Lexus' Japan-based production lines, hindering the marque's near-term sales prospects.
Lexus' U.S. executives stated that due to vehicle shortages amidst close competition from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi, the marque would not remain the country's top-selling premium car brand.
<br><br>

Cumulative sales results for 2011 indicated a 14 percent sales drop in the U.S. market,along with sales increases of 40 percent and 27 percent in Europe and Japan respectively,for a global sales total of 410,000 units.
Lexus' streak of 11 consecutive years as the best-selling luxury marque in the U.S. ended that year, with the title going to BMW followed by Mercedes-Benz.
While 45 percent of Lexus sales in the U.S. in 2011 relied upon the RX luxury crossover SUV, rival Mercedes-Benz's best-selling offering was the E-Class mid-luxury sedan, which commands considerably higher prices.
Subsequently, Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda vowed to restore passion to the marque and further increase its organizational independence, admitting that "...back then we did not regard Lexus as a brand, but as a distribution channel". 
As a result of Toyoda's organizational changes, Lexus senior managers report directly to the chairman for the first time in the marque's history.
<br><br>

In January 2012, the marque began sales of the fourth generation GS line, including GS 350 and GS 450h variants, as well as a lower-displacement GS 250 model for select markets.
In April 2012, the sixth generation ES line, including ES 350 and ES 300h variants, debuted at the New York International Auto Show.
<br><br>

In April 2014, Lexus unveiled the five-seater NX crossover. 
The vehicle features a very first for a Lexus vehicle: a turbocharger. 
Its nomenclature is denoted as the 200t. In August 2014, Toyota announced it would be cutting its Lexus spare parts prices in China by up to 35 percent. 
The company admitted the move was in response to a probe foreshadowed earlier in the month by China's National Development and Reform Commission of Lexus spare parts policies, as part of an industry-wide investigation into what the Chinese regulator considers exorbitantly high prices being charged by automakers for spare parts and after-sales servicing.
<br><br>

In March 2016, Lexus announced that it will be producing a new flagship vehicle: the two-door LC 500. 
The vehicle will be produced for late 2017 in a V8 version putting out 467 horsepower. 
The LC 500h, a V6 hybrid variant, could potentially become available in late 2017 or early 2018.
<br><br>

In April 2019, Lexus announced that a rebadged limousine version of the third-generation Alphard would be sold as the Lexus LM.
It was also announced that Lexus would finally enter the market in Mexico in 2021 with some of the vehicles in their lineup.
In October 2019, Lexus announced that it will be launching the brand's first all-battery electric vehicle in 2020.

<br><br>
<b><u><i>Design and technology</b></u></i>
<br><br>

Lexus design has traditionally placed an emphasis on targeting specific vehicle development standards.
Since the marque's inception, design targets have ranged from aerodynamics and ride quality to interior ergonomics.
The backronym "IDEAL" ("Impressive, Dynamic, Elegant, Advanced, and Lasting") is used in the development process.
Each vehicle is designed according to approximately 500 specific product standards, known as "Lexus Musts," on criteria such as leather seat stitching.
Design elements from the marque's concept vehicle line, the LF series (including the 2003 LF-S and 2004 LF-C), have been incorporated in production models.<br><br>

Vehicle cabins have incorporated electroluminescent Optitron gauges,SmartAccess, a smart key entry and startup system,and multimedia features. 
Beginning with the 2010 RX and HS models, the Remote Touch system, featuring a computer mouse-like controller with haptic feedback, was introduced;other models have featured touchscreen controls (through the 2009 model year) as a navigation screen interface.
2014 saw the introduction of the next version of Lexus’ remote-touch innovations—the Remote Touch Interface Touchpad in the new RC Coupe.<br><br>

In 1989, Lexus became among the first premium car marques to equip models with premium audio systems, in partnership with stereo firm Nakamichi.
Since 2001, optional surround sound systems are offered via high-end audio purveyor Mark Levinson.
For reduced cabin noise, the first LS 400 introduced sandwich steel plating,and later models added acoustic glass.
In 2006, the LS 460 debuted the first ceiling air diffusers and infrared body temperature sensors in a car.
Telematics services include G-Book with G-Link in Asia and Lexus Enform in North America.<br><br>

In 2006, Lexus incorporated the first production eight-speed automatic transmission in an automobile with the LS 460,and the gearbox was later adapted for the GS 460 and IS F models. 
Continuously variable transmissions, regenerative brakes, and electric motors have been used on all Lexus hybrid models.
In 2007, Lexus executives signaled intentions to equip further models with hybrid powertrains,catering to demands for a decrease in both carbon pollution and oil reliance.
Hybrid models have been differentiated by separate badging and lighting technology; in 2008, the LS 600h L became the first production vehicle to use LED headlamps.<br><br>

Safety features on Lexus models range from stability and handling programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems.In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, as part of the LS 460 PCS.
As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion.Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.<br><br>

Production models in development have included convertibles, crossovers, and dedicated hybrids.
Under the F marque, Lexus plans to produce high-performance vehicles with its first expressions being the IS F and the LFA. 
Lexus officials have also discussed standard production model usage of varying platforms.
The LS uses a dedicated platform, while the entry-level Lexus ES had been criticized for being too similar to the Toyota Camry, with which it shared platforms until its sixth generation,in both styling and powertrain design.
The Nürburgring test track in Germany has also seen Lexus prototype testing.<br><br>

<b>L-finesse</b>
<br><br>

Lexus introduced a new design language known as "L-finesse" in the mid-2000s with its LF series concepts and the 2006 Lexus GS.
L-finesse is represented by three Japanese kanji characters which translate as "Intriguing Elegance, Incisive Simplicity, and Seamless Anticipation".
Design characteristics, including a fastback profile, lower-set grille,and the use of both convex and concave surfaces,are derived from Japanese cultural motifs (e.g. the phrase kirikaeshi in arrowhead shapes).
While earlier Lexus models were criticized for reserved and derivative styling, and often mistaken for understated domestic market cars,automotive design analyses described L-finesse as adding a distinctive nature and embrace of Japanese design identity.
Opinions varied for L-finesse's debut on the GS; Sports Car International's analysis praised the vehicle's in-person appearance;Automobile Magazine criticized the daring of its forward styling,and compared subsequent rival models for design similarities.
In 2012, the arrival of the redesigned fourth generation Lexus GS featured the introduction of a spindle-shaped grille design, intended to be used on all forthcoming Lexus models.[146] L-finesse exhibitions were presented at Milan's Salone del Mobile from 2005 through 2009.
